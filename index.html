    <h2>OUR MISSION</h2> 
    <p id="mission">  
     Everyone thinks of chickens as a source of food or a fashion statement. They neglect the very fact that having one as a companion might actually be a life changing concept. LIT CHICKS, INC. allows to give chickens a chance to be loved and cared for like any other pet! You can potty train them (when they're willing... depends on the chicken and how stubborn they are...). You can even stay on top of your schedule, allow them be your alarm clock every morning so you're never ever late to an appointment, a class, a meeting, - to any event! Another amazing perk is how chickens, like any species, come with all different kinds of personalities and backgrounds! <em><strong>ADOPT A LITTY LITTLE CHICKEN TODAY!</strong></em>

    <b>To Potential Pet Owners</b> <br>
    As we said before, all chicks are different. When you check out who we have available, they may have just been rescued from a chicken nugget slaughterhouse. Those chickens typically are kept in our rehab department in order to reintroduce them to a non-violent setting. These chickens may be up for display but they will have a little notice that will inform where they are at in the rehab period and how much longer they will be. <strong>Do not touch the chickens if they are in rehab without a volunteer employee on site!</strong> Respect a chicken's feelings and they will respect you.

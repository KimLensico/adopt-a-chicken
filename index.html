    <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
    Everyone thinks of chickens as a source of food or a fashion statement. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,<br> 
    They neglect the very fact that having one as a companion might actually be a life changing concept. <br>
    LIT CHICKS, INC. allows to give chickens a chance to be loved and cared for like any other pet! <br>
    You can potty train them (when they're willing... depends on the chicken and how stubborn they are...). <br> 
    You can even stay on top of your schedule, allow them be your alarm clock every morning so you're <br>
    never ever late to an appointment, a class, a meeting, - to any event! Another amazing perk is how <br>
    chickens, like any species, come with all different kinds of personalities and backgrounds!  <br>

     <h4>To Potential Pet Owners</h4>
    As we said before, all chicks are different. When you check out who we have available, they may have <br>
    just been rescued from a chicken nugget slaughterhouse. Those chickens typically are kept in our rehab <br>
    department in order to reintroduce them to a non-violent setting. These chickens may be up for display <br>
    but they will have a little notice that will inform where they are at in the rehab period and how much <br>
    longer they will be. <strong>do not touch the chickens if they are in rehab without a volunteer employee on site!</strong><br>
    Respect a chicken's feelings and they will respect you. <br>
